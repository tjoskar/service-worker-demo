This repo contains a few service worker demos.

How to use:
```
1 Clone
2 Start api mock (cd api-server && npm install express && node server.js)
3 Start {no-sw || basic || full} demo by starting one of the python servers (python server.py)
```

This git repo was created for a presentation and will probably be taken down in a few days.
